Overview
This eCommerce web application serves as a platform for listing and selling products. Users can browse different categories, view product details, add items to their cart, and proceed with payment. The goal was to create a user-friendly, intuitive interface that demonstrates skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Key objectives of the project:

Practice building responsive web pages using HTML and CSS.
Implement dynamic features with JavaScript (e.g., updating cart, validating forms).
Demonstrate how a payment flow can be integrated into a front-end application.
Features
Home Page: Highlights featured products and promotions.
Shop Page: Displays a list of products along with their names, images, prices, and descriptions.
About Page: Shares information about the business or brand.
Contact Page: Allows users to submit inquiries or feedback via a contact form.
Shopping Cart: Users can add/remove products from the cart and view the total price dynamically.
Payment Section: Facilitates a mock or real payment process. Integrates basic form validations for secure transactions.
Technologies Used
HTML5: For creating the structure and layout of the web pages.
CSS3: For styling the web pages, ensuring a responsive and visually appealing design.
JavaScript (ES6+): For adding interactivity, form validation, and dynamic behaviors (e.g., cart update logic).
(Optional) Any External Libraries/Frameworks: If you used any libraries like Bootstrap or a payment library (e.g., Stripe) make sure to list them here.

Usage
Home Page:

Launch the site by opening index.html.
Explore featured items or navigate via the menu.
Shopping:

Go to shop.html to view available products.
Select desired items to add them to your cart.
Cart & Checkout:

Access the cart (usually via a cart icon or link) to review items.
Proceed to the payment.html or checkout page to finalize your purchase.
Contact/Feedback:

Visit contact.html to send messages or inquiries.
About Section:

Learn about the business or brand story in the about.html page.
Payment Integration
If you have integrated a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, PayPal, or a mock payment service), follow these steps:

Sign up and configure a payment gateway account (if using a real service).
Add the gateway script or API keys to payment.html or main.js. Make sure to keep sensitive information secure (using environment variables on a real server if possible).
Test the payment flow using test credentials before going live.
Deployment:
If your payment gateway requires a backend for secure transactions, deploy that backend to a hosting platform (e.g., Heroku, Netlify Functions, AWS Lambda, etc.).
Ensure the front-end environment variables point to your backend service.
For the purposes of a front-end internship project, a simple mock payment form or a test environment integration is sufficient to demonstrate the process.
